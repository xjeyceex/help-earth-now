      moreInfo: 'Rising sea levels result from melting ice caps and glaciers and thermal expansion of seawater, leading to the loss of homes, arable land, and critical infrastructure. Increased flooding and erosion threaten freshwater supplies and create significant economic challenges, particularly for coastal communities dependent on tourism and fishing.',

      moreInfo: 'Wildfires are exacerbated by climate change, leading to more severe damage to ecosystems and releasing significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, worsening global warming. These fires threaten air quality, contribute to respiratory diseases, and force communities to evacuate, resulting in economic losses and long-term psychological impacts on affected populations.',

      moreInfo: 'Droughts have far-reaching consequences on agriculture, drinking water supplies, and food security, leading to famine and displacement in vulnerable regions. The agricultural sector suffers significantly, with crop failures and livestock losses, which can escalate food prices and increase competition for resources, leading to social unrest.',

      description: 'The polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, contributing to sea level rise and threatening polar ecosystems.',
      moreInfo: "The loss of Arctic and Antarctic ice disrupts global weather patterns, accelerates sea level rise, and puts species like polar bears and penguins at risk of extinction. The melting ice also impacts Indigenous communities that rely on these ecosystems for their livelihoods, as well as global climate patterns by reducing the Earth's albedo effect, which helps regulate temperatures.",

      description: 'Heatwaves are becoming more intense and prolonged, endangering public health, agriculture, and energy supplies.',
      moreInfo: 'Extreme heat events cause heat-related illnesses and deaths, strain power grids, and reduce crop yields, exacerbating food insecurity. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, are at greater risk. The agricultural sector also faces challenges as heat stress on crops reduces yields and quality, impacting food supply and prices.',

      moreInfo: 'Warmer ocean temperatures and changing weather patterns are contributing to more powerful and destructive storms, displacing millions and costing billions in damages. The increase in storm frequency and intensity leads to higher insurance premiums, infrastructure repair costs, and long-term displacement for communities, significantly affecting local economies and recovery efforts.',

As species struggle to adapt or migrate to suitable habitats, ecosystems become imbalanced, affecting ecosystem services such as pollination, clean water, and climate regulation, which are vital for human survival.',
